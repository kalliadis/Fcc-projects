    <h2>Origin and variations</h2>
    <p>One of the most beloved and famous dishes around the world,</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>We'll try to stick close to an "original" recipe here, so below we have the ingredients for two people:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>200 grams of spaghetti</li>
      <li>100 grams of guanciale or pancetta</li>
      <li>50 grams of pecorino cheese or parmesan</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> First we put the pasta in boiling salted water. Stir them for a few minutes until they soften a little bit, so they wont get stuck with each other. We want them al dente, so keep an eye on  boiling time. About cooking time we can simply follow the instructions given on the package.</li>
      <li>While boiling the pasta we'll want to prepare a mixture of eggs and cheese, by mixing eggs and cheese. I know, you weren't expecting that! Add some black pepper to the mixture and we'll leave that aside, to take a nap. We'll use it later on.</li>
      <li>Cut the guanciale in small pieces and fry it in a pan, on medium to high heat, until it's nice and brown. It'll fry on its own fat so there's no need to add anything else.</li>
      <li>Once both the guanciale and the pasta is ready, take them out of the water and directly in to the pan, mixing them well over high heat for a few seconds, so they'll be seasoned with the guanciale fat. Yum!</li>
      <li>Now it's time to make scrambled spaghetti eggs! What? We are making carbonara? Oh well, we can use it for that too. Pour the egg mixture in the pan and stir quickly. We should remove the pan from the heat before we add in the mix you say? Yeah... of course I knew that.. The pan has to be warm, but not hot enough, so the eggs will turn into a creamy sauce. If it feels kinda fluid, add some more cheese as you stir them.       </li>
    <li>Now that everything's cooked and ready, and we didn't make anything explode in the kitchen, it's time to place the pasta on plates. Add some black pepper on top and there you have it! It's a dish best eaten right after you cook it, so sit down and enjoy ignoring the mess you made in the kitchen. Hurah!</li> 
    </ol>
